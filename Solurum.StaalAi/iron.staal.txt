Avoid adding async. Keeps things single-threaded where possible to avoid complexity.
Prefer to use interfaces, classes and polymorphism above inheritence.
Avoid the use of the ASP.NET Dependency Injection Framework beyond what already exists.
Preference to classic Factory or Builder patterns.
Preference to Public and Private.
Make sure dependency injection and interfaces are used in classes where applicable so they can be unit-tested.
Stick to <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
Above all, always prefer simplicity of code.
