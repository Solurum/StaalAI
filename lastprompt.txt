Title: Fix crash when succesfully completing

Description:
Everytime this tool finishes succesfully it seems to log as a crash. We need to fix this.
For example:
 [16:06:39 INF] ChatGPT conversation stopped. Duration: 429s | API Calls: 9 | Bytes In: 62401 | Bytes Out: 19747 | Input Tokens: 83754 | Output Tokens: 15665 | Est. Cost (USD): $0.0105
[16:06:39 ERR] Critical Error while handling ChatGPT response. Stopping.
System.InvalidOperationException: Conversation not started. Call Start() first.

[16:06:39 DBG] Hosting stopped

This was a valid conversation, it stopped correctly. But something either throws an exception after that point or it's incorrectly seeing this.
The fact I see "Conversation not started. Call Start() first.  would be to first thing I would look for. One of the possibilities is that we're maybe still getting code running after we stopped the conversation.

Try to achieve this with minimal code changes, focus on fixing this problem.
