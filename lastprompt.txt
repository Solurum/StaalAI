Title: Fix potential infinite loop, LLM not understanding finish command

Description:
LLM's sometimes keep returning status messages saying they're done, completed the work or finished. But thats invalid, they should understand to send back the STAAL_FINISH_OK command with a PR comment included such as specifiek in AllowedCommands.txt.

I want you to review the AllowedCommands.txt and see if we need to make changes there so it's more understandable for LLM's.
I also want you to create a reminderprompt.txt that we can include with our response to a status message every 5 status messages we receives. Make sure to add some unit tests for that new code as well. The reminderprompt can be based on what's inside MasterPrompt, just make sure it focuses on an LLM that's already busy and makes it clear the tool is just sending a small reminder including what to send if it finished OK or NOK.
