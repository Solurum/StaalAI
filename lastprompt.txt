Title: Update all documentation and readme

Description:
We need to go through all the code, cleanup all documentation and readme.
Don't adjust any actual logic or tests.

The ReadMe should describe how to use the tool, written without emoticons and professionally.
Add code examples for the different ways the tool can be used.
