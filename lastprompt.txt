Title: Adjust StaalAI CI/CD Pipeline: uncompleted review remarks

Description:
I want you to change the CICD Pipeline that executes the StaalAI tool after a PR gets a remark with the execute command.
I want you to check if there are open review remarks, then grab those with the information needed (like file location). Format it nicely for a plain text file and then change the lastpromp.txt. Add a line of text at the top saying the Prompt was already executed and there are open review remarks to tackle. Then add to the bottom all those review remarks.  I suggest you first make a lastpromp_bak.txt file with the old content (original prompt) and then before doing a commit & push with any changes have a step that deleted lastprompt.txt and renames lastptompt_bak.txt to lastprompt.txt (restoring the original lastprompt file). That way, we don't need the complexities of constantly checking if a review remark was already added to the lastprompt.txt.

If there are no open review remarks, then just run as before.
