Title: Actually Send Back the PR message from STAAL_FINISH_OK

Description:
I just noticed that when the StaalAI Execute workflow  stops it doesn't actually provide the PR message that is returned when STAAL_FINISH_OK  is sent by the LLM. Can you make the necessary code changes both in the STAAL_FINISH_OK logic to save the PR message from the LLM to a text file. Then in the pipeline yml make changes to use that as the PR text.

I suggest a new argument in the tool where a user can provide the path to a text file to hold the AI Summary. Then use that path to store the STAAL_FINISH_OK pr message. And use that path in the workflow to make the PR.

Make sure to add Unit Tests for the new logic.
I suggest asking for multiple file contents at the same time to avoid timing out. You're only allowed 20 calls without performing STAAL_CONTENT_CHANGE to make file changes.
